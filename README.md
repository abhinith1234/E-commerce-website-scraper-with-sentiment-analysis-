# E-commerce website scraper + sentiment analyser 

The growing volume of online data is accelerating business adoption of data-driven decision making strategies and it has been estimated that data-driven companies are 19 times more likely to be profitable, and are 52% better at understanding their customers. This makes web scraping crucial for businesses that rely on data, especially online e-commerce platforms which make use of publicly available data in order to analyze competitors, monitor customers, and generate leads.

With a large percentage of retail activities taking place online, e-commerce web scraping offers massive potential for online retailers to differentiate and grow. Web data can enable online retailers to optimize their strategies by tracking competitors, enrich product listings, understand customers’ needs, and stay on top of market trends.

#### Selenium
To scrape the web pages, there are several libraries for web-scraping in python such as BeautifulSoup, Selenium, and Scrapy. In this article I am going to use Selenium as it can work like a real user starting from opening a browser, type a keyword in a search box and then click to find the result.

Outlines:
1. Install Selenium and download a web driver
2. Access the Amazon website
3. Specify WebElement(s)
4. Extract the data from WebElement(s)

For other browsers you can find the links for download in this page: https://pypi.org/project/selenium/

#### UI
  <li>The UI has been made with flask.
  <li>Use of HTML,CSS
